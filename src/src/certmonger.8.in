.SH NAME
certmonger

.SH SYNOPSIS
certmonger [-s|-S] [-L|-l] [-P SOCKET] [-b TIMEOUT|-B] [-n|-f] [-d LEVEL] [-p FILE] [-F] [-C cmd]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIcertmonger\fR daemon monitors certificates for impending
expiration, and can optionally refresh soon-to-be-expired certificates
with the help of a CA.  If told to, it can drive the entire enrollment
process from key generation through enrollment and refresh.

The daemon provides a control interface via the \fI@CM_DBUS_NAME@\fR
service, with which client tools such as \fBgetcert\fR(1) interact.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-s
Listen on the session bus rather than the system bus.
.TP
-S
Listen on the system bus rather than the session bus.  This is the default.
.TP
-l
Also listen on a private socket for connections from clients running under the
same UID.
.TP
-L
Listen only on a private socket for connections from clients running under the
same UID, and skip connecting to a bus.
.TP
-P
Specify a location for the private listening socket.  If the location beings
with a '/' character, it will be prefixed with 'unix:path=', otherwise it will
be prefixed with 'unix:'.  If this option is not specified, the listening
socket, if one is created, will be placed in the abstract namespace.
.TP
-b TIMEOUT
Behave as a bus-activated service: if there are no certificates to be monitored
or obtained, and no requests are received within TIMEOUT seconds, exit.  Not
compatible with the -C option.
.TP
-B
Don't behave as a bus-activated service.  This is the default.
.TP
-n
Don't fork, and log messages to stderr rather than syslog.
.TP
-f
Do fork, and log messages to syslog rather than stderr.  This is the default.
.TP
-d LEVEL
Set debugging level.  Higher values produce more debugging output.  Implies -n.
.TP
-p FILE
Store the daemon's process ID in the named file.
.TP
-F
Force NSS to be initialized in FIPS mode.  The default behavior is to heed
the setting stored in \fI/proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled\fR.
.TP
-C cmd
After the service has initialized, run the specified command, then shut down
the service after the command exits.  If the -l or -L option was also
specified, the command will be run with the \fI@CERTMONGER_PVT_ADDRESS_ENV@\fR
environment variable set to the listening socket's location.  Not compatible
with the -b option.

.SH FILES
The set of certificates being monitored or signed is tracked using files stored
under \fI@CM_STORE_REQUESTS_DIRECTORY@\fR, or in a directory named by the
\fI@CM_STORE_REQUESTS_DIRECTORY_ENV@\fR environment variable.

The set of known CAs is tracked using files stored
under \fI@CM_STORE_CAS_DIRECTORY@\fR, or in a directory named by the
\fI@CM_STORE_CAS_DIRECTORY_ENV@\fR environment variable.

Temporary files will be stored in "\fI@CM_TMPDIR@\fR", or in the directory
named by the \fI@CM_TMPDIR_ENV@\fR environment variable if that value was
not given at compile time.
