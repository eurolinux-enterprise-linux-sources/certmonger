.SH NAME
certmonger

.SH SYNOPSIS
certmonger [-s|-S] [-b TIMEOUT|-B] [-n|-f] [-d LEVEL] [-p FILE]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIcertmonger\fR daemon monitors certificates for impending
expiration, and can optionally refresh soon-to-be-expired certificates
with the help of a CA.  If told to, it can drive the entire enrollment
process from key generation through enrollment and refresh.

The daemon provides a control interface via the \fI@CM_DBUS_NAME@\fR
service, with which client tools such as \fBgetcert\fR(1) interact.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-s
Listen on the session bus rather than the system bus.
.TP
-S
Listen on the system bus rather than the session bus.  This is the default.
.TP
-b TIMEOUT
Behave as a bus-activated service: if there are no certificates to be monitored
or obtained, and no requests received within TIMEOUT seconds, exit.
.TP
-B
Don't behave as a bus-activated service.  This is the default.
.TP
-n
Don't fork, and log messages to stderr rather than syslog.
.TP
-f
Do fork, and log messages to syslog rather than stderr.  This is the default.
.TP
-d LEVEL
Set debugging level.  Higher values produce more debugging output.  Implies -n.
.TP
-p FILE
Store the daemon's process ID in the named file.

.SH FILES
The set of certificates being monitored or signed is tracked using files stored
under \fI@CM_STORE_REQUESTS_DIRECTORY@\fR, or in a directory named by the
\fI@CM_STORE_REQUESTS_DIRECTORY_ENV@\fR environment variable.

The set of known CAs is tracked using files stored
under \fI@CM_STORE_CAS_DIRECTORY@\fR, or in a directory named by the
\fI@CM_STORE_CAS_DIRECTORY_ENV@\fR environment variable.

Temporary files will be stored in "\fI@CM_TMPDIR@\fR", or in the directory
named by the \fI@CM_TMPDIR_ENV@\fR environment variable if that value was
not given at compile time.
