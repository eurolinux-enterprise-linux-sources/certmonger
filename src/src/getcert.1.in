.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIgetcert\fR tool issues requests to a @CM_DBUS_NAME@ service on
behalf of the invoking user.  It can ask the service to begin
enrollment, optionally generating a key pair to use, it can ask the
service to begin monitoring a certificate in a specified location for
expiration, and optionally to refresh it when expiration nears, it can
list the set of certificates that the service is already monitoring, or
it can list the set of CAs that the service is capable of using.

If no command is given as the first command-line argument, \fIgetcert\fR
will print short usage information for each of its functions.

.SH COMMON ARGUMENTS
All commands can take either the \fB-s\fR or \fB-S\fR arguments, which
instruct \fIgetcert\fR to contact the @CM_DBUS_NAME@ service on the
session or system bus, respectively.  By default, \fIgetcert\fR consults
the @CM_DBUS_NAME@ service attached to the system bus.
