.TH certmonger.conf 5 "11 June 2014" "certmonger Manual"

.SH NAME
certmonger.conf - configuration file for certmonger

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIcertmonger.conf\fR file contains default settings used by certmonger.
Its format is more or less that of a typical INI-style file.  The only sections
currently of note are named \fIdefaults\fR and \fIselfsign\fR.

.SH DEFAULTS
Within the \fIdefaults\fR section, these variables and values are recognized:

.IP notify_ttls
This is the list of times, given in seconds, before a certificate's not-after
validity date
(often referred to as its expiration time) when \fIcertmonger\fR should warn
that the certificate will soon no longer be valid.
If this value is not specified, \fIcertmonger\fR will attempt to use the value
of the \fIttls\fR setting.  The default list of values is "@CM_DEFAULT_TTL_LIST@".

.IP enroll_ttls
This is the list of times, given in seconds, before a certificate's not-after
validity date
(often referred to as its expiration time) when \fIcertmonger\fR should attempt
to automatically renew the certificate, if it is configured to do so.
If this value is not specified, \fIcertmonger\fR will attempt to use the value
of the \fIttls\fR setting.  The default list of values is "@CM_DEFAULT_TTL_LIST@".

.IP notification_method
This is the method by which \fIcertmonger\fP will notify the system
administrator that a certificate will soon become invalid.  The recognized
values are \fIsyslog\fP, \fImail\fP, and \fIcommand\fP.  The default is \fIsyslog\fP.
When sending mail, the notification message will be the mail message subject.
When invoking a command, the notification message will be available in the
"@CM_NOTIFICATION_ENV@" environment variable.

.IP notification_destination
This is the destination to which \fIcertmonger\fP will send notifications.  It
can be a syslog priority and/or facility, separated by a period, it can be
an email address, or it can be a command to run.  The default value is
\fI@CM_DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION_SYSLOG_PRIORITY@\fP.

.IP key_type
This is the type of key pair which will be generated, used in certificate
signing requests, and used when self-signing certificates.
@NO_MAN_DSA@\fIRSA\fR is supported.
@MAN_DSA@\fIRSA\fR and \fIDSA\fR are supported.
@MAN_EC@\fIEC\fR (also known as \fIECDSA\fR) is also supported.
The default is \fIRSA\fP.

.IP symmetric_cipher
This is the symmetric cipher which will be used to encrypt private keys stored
in OpenSSL's PEM format.  Recognized values include \fIaes128\fP and
\fIaes256\fP.  The default is \fIaes128\fP.  It is not recommended that this
value be changed except in cases where the default is incompatible with other
software.

.IP digest
This is the digest algorithm which will be used when signing certificate
signing requests and self-signed certificates.  Recognized values include
\fIsha1\fP, \fIsha256\fP, \fIsha384\fP, and \fIsha512\fP.  The default is
\fIsha256\fP.  It is not recommended that this value be changed except in cases
where the default is incompatible with other software.

.IP nss_ca_trust
These are the trust attributes which are applied to CA certificates which should be trusted, when they
are saved to NSS databases.  The default is \fICT,C,C\fP.

.IP nss_other_trust
These are the trust attributes which are applied to certificates which are not
necessarily to be trusted, when they are saved to NSS databases.  The default
is \fI,,\fP.

.SH SELFSIGN
Within the \fIselfsign\fR section, these variables and values are recognized:

.IP validity_period
This is the validity period given to self-signed certificates.  The value is
specified as a combination of years (y), months (M), weeks (w), days (d), hours
(h), minutes (m), and/or seconds (s).  If no unit of time is specified, seconds
are assumed.  The default value is \fI@CM_DEFAULT_CERT_LIFETIME@\fR.

.IP populate_unique_id
This controls whether or not self-signed certificates will have their
subjectUniqueID and issuerUniqueID fields populated.  While RFC5280 prohibits
their use, they may be needed and/or used by older applications.  The default
value is \fI@CM_DEFAULT_POPULATE_UNIQUE_ID@\fR.

.SH LOCAL
Within the \fIlocal\fR section, these variables and values are recognized:

.IP validity_period
This is the validity period given to the locally-signed CA's certificate when it
is generated.  The value is specified as a combination of years (y), months
(M), weeks (w), days (d), hours (h), minutes (m), and/or seconds (s).  If no
unit of time is specified, seconds are assumed.  If not set, the value of the
\fIvalidity_period\fR setting from the \fIselfsign\fR section, if one is set
there, will be used.  The default value is \fI@CM_DEFAULT_CERT_LIFETIME@\fR.
