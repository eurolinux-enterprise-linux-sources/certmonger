.SH NAME
getcert

.SH SYNOPSIS
getcert start-tracking [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Tells \fIcertmonger\fR to monitor an already-issued certificate.
Optionally, when the certificate nears expiration, use an existing key
pair (or to generate one if one is not already found in the specified
location), to generate a signing request using the key pair and to
submit them for signing to a CA.

.SH SPECIFYING EXISTING REQUESTS
.TP
\fB\-i\fR NAME
Modify the request which has this nickname.  If this option is not specified,
and a tracking entry which matches the key and certificate storage options
which are specified already exists, that entry will be modified.  Otherwise, a
new tracking entry will be added.

.SH KEY AND CERTIFICATE STORAGE OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-d\fR DIR
Use an NSS database in the specified directory for reading this
certificate and, if possible, the corresponding key.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR NAME
Use the certificate with this nickname, and if a private key with the
same nickname or which corresponds to the certificate is available, to
use it, too.
Only valid with \fB\-d\fR.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR TOKEN
If the NSS database has more than one token available, use the token
with this name for accessing the certificate and key.  This argument
only rarely needs to be specified.
Only valid with \fB\-d\fR.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR FILE
Read the certificate from this file.  For safety's sake, do not use the
same file specified with the \fB\-k\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR FILE
Use the key stored in this file to generate a signing request for
refreshing the certificate.  If no such file is found when needed,
generate a new key pair and store them in the file.
Only valid with \fB\-f\fR.

.SH KEY ENCRYPTION OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-p\fR FILE
The private key files or databases are encrypted using the PIN stored in the
named file as the passphrase.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR PIN
The private key files or databases are encrypted using the specified PIN as the
passphrase.  Because command-line arguments to running processes are trivially
discoverable, use of this option is not recommended except for testing.

.SH TRACKING OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-I\fR NAME
Assign the specified nickname to this task.  If this option is not specified,
a name will be assigned automatically.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Attempt to obtain a new certificate from the CA when the expiration date of a
certificate nears.  This is the default setting.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR
Don't attempt to obtain a new certificate from the CA when the expiration date
of a certificate nears.  If this option is specified, an expired certificate
will simply stay expired.

.SH ENROLLMENT OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR NAME
Enroll with the specified CA rather than a possible default.  The name of
the CA should correspond to one listed by \fIgetcert list-cas\fR.  Only
useful in combination with \fB\-r\fR.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR NAME
Request a certificate using the named profile, template, or certtype,
from the specified CA.

.SH SIGNING REQUEST OPTIONS
If and when \fIcertmonger\fR attempts to obtain a new certificate to replace
the one being monitored, the values to be added to the signing request will be
taken from the current certificate, unless preferred values are set using one
or more of \fB-u\R, \fB\-U\fR, \fB\-K\fR, \fB\-E\fR, and \fB\-D\fR.

.TP
\fB\-u\fR keyUsage
Add an extensionRequest for the specified keyUsage to the
signing request.  The keyUsage value is expected to be one of these names:

digitalSignature

nonRepudiation

keyEncipherment

dataEncipherment

keyAgreement

keyCertSign

cRLSign

encipherOnly

decipherOnly
.TP
\fB\-U\fR EKU
Add an extensionRequest for the specified extendedKeyUsage to the
signing request.  The EKU value is expected to be an object identifier
(OID).
.TP
\fB\-K\fR NAME
Add an extensionRequest for a subjectAltName, with the specified Kerberos
principal name as its value, to the signing request.
.TP
\fB\-E\fR EMAIL
Add an extensionRequest for a subjectAltName, with the specified email
address as its value, to the signing request.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR DNSNAME
Add an extensionRequest for a subjectAltName, with the specified DNS name
as its value, to the signing request.
\fB\-A\fR ADDRESS
Add an extensionRequest for a subjectAltName, with the specified IP address
as its value, to the signing request.

.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-B\fR COMMAND
When ever the certificate or the CA's certificates are saved to the
specified locations, run the specified command as the client user before
saving the certificates.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR COMMAND
When ever the certificate or the CA's certificates are saved to the
specified locations, run the specified command as the client user after
saving the certificates.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR DIR
When ever the certificate is saved to the specified location, if root
certificates for the CA are available, save them to the specified NSS database.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR FILE
When ever the certificate is saved to the specified location, if root
certificates for the CA are available, and when the local copies of the
CA's root certificates are updated, save them to the specified file.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR
Wait for the certificate to become valid or to be reissued and saved, or for
the attempt to obtain a new one to fail.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Be verbose about errors.  Normally, the details of an error received from
the daemon will be suppressed if the client can make a diagnostic suggestion.

.SH NOTES
Locations specified for key and certificate storage need to be
accessible to the \fIcertmonger\fR daemon process.  When run as a system
daemon on a system which uses a mandatory access control mechanism such
as SELinux, the system policy must ensure that the daemon is allowed to
access the locations where certificates and keys that it will manage
will be stored (these locations are typically labeled as \fIcert_t\fR or
an equivalent).  More SELinux-specific information can be found in the
\fIselinux.txt\fR documentation file for this package.
