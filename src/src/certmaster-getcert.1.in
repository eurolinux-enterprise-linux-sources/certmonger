.SH SYNOPSIS
 certmaster-getcert request [options]
 certmaster-getcert resubmit [options]
 certmaster-getcert start-tracking [options]
 certmaster-getcert status [options]
 certmaster-getcert stop-tracking [options]
 certmaster-getcert list [options]
 certmaster-getcert list-cas [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIcertmaster-getcert\fR tool issues requests to a @CM_DBUS_NAME@
service on behalf of the invoking user.  It can ask the service to begin
enrollment, optionally generating a key pair to use, it can ask the
service to begin monitoring a certificate in a specified location for
expiration, and optionally to refresh it when expiration nears, it can
list the set of certificates that the service is already monitoring, or
it can list the set of CAs that the service is capable of using.

If no command is given as the first command-line argument,
\fIcertmaster-getcert\fR will print short usage information for each of
its functions.

The \fIcertmaster-getcert\fR tool behaves identically to the generic
\fIgetcert\fR tool when it is used with the \fB-c
\fI@CM_CERTMASTER_CA_NAME@\fR option.

There is no standard authenticated method for obtaining the root certificate
from certmaster CAs, so \fBcertmonger\fR does not support retrieving trust
information from them.  While the \fB-F\fR and \fB-a\fR options will still
be recognized, they will effectively be ignored.
