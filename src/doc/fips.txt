Notes on running in FIPS mode:

* All NSS databases need PINs, typically UTF-8 values of 7-255 characters
  in length, composed of at members of least three of these classes:
  * Upper-case ASCII character (unless it's the first character)
  * Lower-case ASCII character
  * Digit (unless it's the last character)
  * Other ASCII character
  * Other character

* Attempts to generate keys of certain sizes less than allowed by the
  underlying crypto libraries will fail.  The daemon will attempt to retry
  using its compile-time default key size.
